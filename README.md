- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mac-iX and I'm a writer.
- 👀 I’m interested in using Markdown on Github to edit content and documentation for websites. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Markdown, Github, and a few commands in HTML, Linux, Java etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technical writing and content writing objectives with a focus on keyword optimization and client acquisition.
